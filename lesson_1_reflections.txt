How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

1. Made it easy to see the differences between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

1. You can see where issues were introduced and if you want to throw away recent code you can go back to an earlier version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

1. Pros - You can choose when and what to commit and make sure the correct items are included

2. Cons - You might forget to commit, or put too much or too little in the commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

1. Changes go together and can span multiple files.  Google docs treats documents singlely, not as a whole.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

1. See what the changes were between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

1. You can always go back and undo them easily.
