When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. When you want to have a backup, share the repository, have other people edit, use another device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1. You may want to test changes first before trying out new code that has been changed, and then merge your changes in.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

1. Forks make a copy of someone else's code that can be used when you want to make changes, but not modify their code.
2. Clones made a copy of a repository from a remote branch or on your local branch so you can modify it.
3. Branches are spinoffs from the current branch that allow expirements to be made without affecting the main coding branch.
